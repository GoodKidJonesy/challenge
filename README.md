## Interview Challenge

This is a simple React app that allows the user to search for a location, and in turn get the relevant weather information.

The **required features are working** and have already been implemented, but the implementation can be improved in many different ways.

Given the existing solution, **refactor and tidy** the code to what you believe would be a better implementation while keeping **accessibility** in mind. The goal is to end up with a more flexible solution to be able to accommodate further required features.

## Getting Started

 - Clone the repository
 - Run **`yarn`** or **`npm i`** to install required dependencies
 - Run **`yarn dev`** or **`npm run dev`** to start server
 - Run **`yarn test`** or **`npm run test`** to run tests

## Bonus Ideas

 - Implement a theme switcher i.e. **Dark / Light Mode**
 - Make styling responsive
 - Extended app with additional data being displayed, or more user control
